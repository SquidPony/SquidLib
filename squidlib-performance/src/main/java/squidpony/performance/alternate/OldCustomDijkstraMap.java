/**
 * An alternative to AStarSearch when you want to fully explore a search space, or when you want a gradient
 * floodfill, with customizable rules for what is considered adjacent. This can be used for games where
 * rotation matters (and possibly costs movement), for games with thin walls (where a wall between cells
 * prevents travel between those two cells even if the wall doesn't occupy a walkable cell), for games where
 * the edges between cells may have some requisite to travel across, like a vertical amount that must be
 * hopped up or down between cells, and for games that have portals between distant cells on the same map.
 * <br>
 * As a bit of introduction, the article http://www.roguebasin.com/index.php?title=Dijkstra_Maps_Visualized can
 * provide some useful information on how these work and how to visualize the information they can produce, while
 * http://www.roguebasin.com/index.php?title=The_Incredible_Power_of_Dijkstra_Maps is an inspiring list of the
 * various features Dijkstra Maps can enable.

 * If you can't remember how to spell this, just remember: Does It Just Know Stuff? That's Really Awesome!
