/**
 * A subclass of StatefulRNG (and thus RNG) that allows customizing many parts of the random number generation.
 * This is meant to be a more comprehensible version of the functionality present in RandomBias, and also for it to be
 * easier to use with methods that expect an RNG.
 * <br>
 * You can change the expected average for the values this produces, which uses the RandomBias.EXPONENTIAL distribution,
 * with all the caveats it has: it strongly favors either high or low values when the average gets especially high or
 * low, but it can essentially cover all averages between 0.0 and 1.0 (this class limits it to 0.1 and 0.9, so other
 * techniques can be used effectively).
 * <br>
 * You can also affect the "centrality" of random numbers, causing more to occur near the expected average (a bell curve
 * effect), or cause more near extreme ends of the random number spectrum. In practice, centrality changes are hard to
 * notice, but may be useful to simulate certain effects. An example of centrality changes in existing games include the
 * Nintendo title Advance Wars 2, where a brutish commander could increase the amount of damage his units dealt but also
 * suffered unpredictability; attacks could deal even more or much less damage than normal without any way to build
 * tactics around it. Square Enix's Final Fantasy XII also notably differentiated certain weapons (axes, hammers, and
 * "hand-cannons") from other similar options by making them deal less predictable damage. In both cases the connotation
 * is that more randomness is fitting for a brute-force approach to combat where pre-planned strategies are less
 * emphasized. It should also be noted that increasing the frequency of extreme results makes small bonuses to defense
 * or offense typically less useful, and small penalties less harmful. The opposite can be true for a carefully tuned
 * game where the most common results are tightly clustered, and most target numbers are just slightly above the
 * ordinary average. In tabletop games, 1d20 and 3d6 have the same average, but 1d20 is uniform, where 3d6 is clustered
 * around 10 and 11, each the result of 1/8 of rolls on their own and 1/4 together. This makes the case where a +1 bonus
 * to succeed changes the outcome on approximately 5% of 1d20 rolls, regardless of the required number to succeed if it
 * is less than 20. However, a +1 bonus matters on a variable portion of 3d6 rolls; if you become able to succeed on a
 * 10 or 11 where that was a failure before, the bonus applies approximately 12.5% of the time. Becoming able to succeed
 * on an 18 where that was a failure before is essentially worthless, affecting less than 0.5% of rolls. This property
 * of centralized results should be considered if game balance and/or the lethality of combat is important. One lengthy
 * stretch of extreme results by enemies that work against the favor of a player character generally result in a dead
 * player character, and RNGs that make extreme results more common may seem particularly cruel to players.
 * <br>
 * This generator sets a field, rawLatest, every time a random number is produced. This stores a pseudo-random double
 * between 0.0 (inclusive) and 1.0 (exclusive) that is not subject to the bias an expected average introduces, and is
 * close to uniformly distributed. You should expect rawLatest to be higher when higher numbers are returned from a
 * method like nextInt(), and lower when lower numbers are returned. This can be useful for rare effects that should not
 * be drastically more or less likely when slight changes are made to the expected average; if the expected average is
 * 0.65, many more random doubles from nextDouble() will be between 0.95 and 1.0 (probably more than 10% of random
 * numbers), but rawLatest will only be between 0.95 and 1.0 for close to 5% of all generations.
 * <br>
 * You can get and set the state this uses internally, and this is stored as a 64-bit long.
 * <br>
 * The choice of RandomnessSource doesn't really matter since this will always use a LightRNG internally. LightRNG is
 * the current best StatefulRandomness implementation, with excellent performance characteristics and few flaws, though
 * its relatively low period may sometimes be a detriment.
 * <br>
 * More customizations may be added in the future to the ones available currently.
