     * of your natural lifespan. For the purposes of tests, you may want stable SquidID values to be generated, the same
     * for every startup of the program, generating the same IDs in order. This will change the seed used internally to
     * a constant (large) seed the first time it is called, and it should only be called at or near the start of your
     * program, no more than once. If an ID is requested immediately after calling this method, and then this method is
     * called again, the next ID to be generated will be identical to the previous one generated (a collision). There
     * may be reasons you want this during testing, so there isn't any check for multiple calls to this method. If IDs
     * can persist between runs of the game (i.e. saved in a file), using this is generally a bad idea, and the default
     * random IDs should more than suffice.
     * <br>
     * You can "undo" the effects of this method with randomize(), changing the seed to a new random value.
     * <br>
     * Because IDs aren't likely to have gameplay significance, this uses one seed, the opening paragraph of The
     * Wonderful Wizard of Oz, by Frank L. Baum, which is in the public domain. Changing the seed is unlikely to change
     * the likelihood of collisions, which should be less likely than a tornado transporting you to Oz, as long as this
     * method is called at most once per program run.
