/**
 * An RNG that cannot be seeded and should be fairly hard to predict what it will return next. Useful for competitions
 * where a seeded RNG is used for dungeon generation and enemy placement but an unpredictable RNG is needed for combat,
 * so players can't abuse the RNG to make improbable events guaranteed or unfavorable outcomes impossible. The
 * performance of this as a RandomnessSource is also fairly good, taking approximately 1.5x to 1.7x as long as LightRNG
 * to produce random 64-bit data, and of course it is far faster than java.util.Random (which is 10x slower than this).
 * In the secure random numbers category, where this isn't quite as secure as most, ChaosRNG is about 80x faster than
 * SecureRandom once SecureRandom warms up, which takes about 10 minutes of continuous number generation. Before that,
 * ChaosRNG is about 110x faster than SecureRandom for 64-bit data.
 * <br>
 * This is intended to be used as a RandomnessSource for an RNG, and does not have any methods other than those needed
 * for that interface, with one exception -- the randomize() method, which can be used to completely change all 1024
 * bits of state using cryptographic random numbers. If you create a ChaosRNG and keep it around for later, then you can
 * pass it to the RNG constructor and later call randomize() on the ChaosRNG if you suspect it may be becoming
 * predictable. The period on this RNG is (2 to the 1024) - 1, so predicting it may be essentially impossible unless the
 * user can poke around in the application, use reflection, etc.
