/**
 * A quasi-random number generator that goes through one of many sub-random sequences found by J.G. van der Corput.
 * More specifically, this offers both the normal van der Corput sequence, which only changes the state by incrementing
 * it (this works better in the normal usage as part of a 2D or 3D point generator) and a kind of scrambled van der
 * Corput sequence, where the state changes unpredictably (this works better when using this to generate 1D sequences,
 * or when the base may be larger than 7 or non-prime). In both cases, the state is internally stored in a 64-bit long
 * that is incremented once per generated number, but when scramble is true, the state is altered with something similar
 * to a Gray code before being used; more on this later if you want to read about it. The important things to know about
 * this class are: size of state affects speed (prefer smaller seeds, but quality is sometimes a bit poor at first if
 * you start at 0); the base (when given) should be prime and moderately small (or very small if scramble is false, any
 * of 2, 3, 5, or 7 should be safe); this doesn't generate very random numbers when scramble is false (which can be good
 * for making points that should not overlap), but it will seem much more random when scramble is true; this is a
 * StatefulRandomness with an additional method for generating quasi-random doubles, {@link #nextDouble()}; and there
 * are several static methods offered for convenient generation of points on the related Halton sequence (as well as
 * faster generation of doubles in the base-2 van der Corput sequence, and a special method that switches which base
 * it uses depending on the index to seem even less clearly-patterned).
 * <br>
 * This generator allows a base (also called a radix) that changes the sequence significantly; a base should be prime,
 * and this performs a little better in terms of time used with larger primes, though quality is also improved by
 * preferring primes that aren't very large relative to the quantity of numbers expected to be generated. Unfortunately,
 * performance is not especially similar to conventional PRNGs; smaller (positive) state values are processed more
 * quickly than larger ones, or most negative states. At least one 64-bit integer modulus and one 64-bit integer
 * division are required for any number to be produced, and the amount of both of these relatively-non-cheap operations
 * increases linearly with the number of digits (in the specified base, which is usually not 10) needed to represent
 * the current state. Since performance is not optimal, and the results are rather strange anyway relative to PRNGs,
 * this should not be used as a direct substitute for a typical RandomnessSource (however, it is similar to, but simpler
 * than, {@link squidpony.squidmath.SobolQRNG}). So what's it good for?
 * <br>
 * A VanDerCorputSequence can be a nice building block for more complicated quasi-randomness, especially for points in
 * 2D or 3D, when scramble is false. There's a simple way that should almost always "just work" as the static method
 * {@link #halton(int, int, int)} here. If it doesn't meet your needs, there's a little more complexity involved. Using
 * a VanDerCorputQRNG with base 3 for the x-axis and another VanDerCorputQRNG with base 5 for the y-axis, requesting a
 * double from each to make points between (0.0, 0.0) and (1.0, 1.0), has an interesting trait that can be desirable for
 * many kinds of positioning in 2D: once a point has been generated, an identical point will never be generated until
 * floating-point precision runs out, but more than that, nearby points will almost never be generated for many
 * generations, and most points will stay at a comfortable distance from each other if the bases are different and both
 * prime (as well as, more technically, if they share no common denominators). This is also known as a Halton sequence,
 * which is a group of sequences of points instead of simply numbers. The choices of 3 and 5 are just examples; any two
 * different primes will technically work for 2D, but patterns can become noticeable with primes larger than about 7,
 * with 11 and 13 sometimes acceptable. Three VanDerCorputQRNG sequences could be used for a Halton sequence of 3D
 * points, using three different prime bases, four for 4D, etc. SobolQRNG can be used for the same purpose, but the
 * points it generates are typically more closely-aligned to a specific pattern, the pattern is symmetrical between all
 * four quadrants of the square between (0.0, 0.0) and (1.0, 1.0) in 2D, and it probably extends into higher dimensions.
 * Using one of the possible Halton sequences gives some more flexibility in the kinds of random-like points produced.
 * <br>
 * Because just using the state in a simple incremental fashion puts some difficult requirements on the choice of base
 * and seed, we can use a technique like Gray codes to scramble the state. The sequence of these Gray-like codes for the
 * integers from 0 to 16 is {@code 0, 9, 21, 16, 50, 51, 23, 10, 4, 28, 49, 39, 246, 198, 179, 97, 393}, and this can be
 * generated efficiently with {@code (i * i) ^ ((i * 137) >>> 4)}. No duplicate results were found in any numbers of 20
 * bits or less, and trying to find duplicates in 24 bits exhausted the testing computer's memory, without finding a
 * duplicate. You should be fine.

 * Note on Gray-like code implementation: This is not a typical Gray code. Normally, the operation looks like
 * {@code i ^ (i >>> 1)}, which gives negative results for negative values of i (not wanted here), and also clusters
 * two very similar numbers together for every pair of sequential numbers. An earlier version scrambled with a basic
 * Gray code, but the current style, {@code (i * i) ^ ((i * 137) >>> 4)}, produces much more "wild and crazy" results,
 * but never negative ones. The period of this, if it is seen as a RandomnessSource, is probably about 2^56, at least
 * for reasonably small starting states (under 1000 or so?). This is ideal for a scramble.
