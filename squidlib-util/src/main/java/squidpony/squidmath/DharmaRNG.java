/**
 * An alteration to a RandomnessSource that attempts to produce values that are perceived as fair to an imperfect user.
 * <p>
 * This takes a RandomnessSource, defaulting to a LightRNG, and uses it to generate random values, but tracks the total
 * and compares it to the potential total of a generator of only numbers with a desired value (default 0.54,
 * so it compares against a sequence of all 0.54). If the current generated total is too high or low compared to the
 * desired total, the currently used seed is possibly changed, the generated number is moved in the direction of the
 * desired fairness, and it returns that instead of the number that would have pushed the current generated total
 * beyond the desired threshold. The new number, if one is changed, will always be closer to the desired fairness.
 * This is absolutely insecure for cryptographic purposes, but should seem more "fair" to a player than a
 * random number generator that seeks to be truly random.
 * You can create multiple DharmaRNG objects with different fairness values and seeds, and use favorable generators
 * (with fairness greater than 0.54) for characters that need an easier time, or unfavorable generators if you want
 * the characters that use that RNG to be impeded somewhat.
 * The name comes from the Wheel of Dharma.
 * This class currently will have a slight bias toward lower numbers with many RNGs unless fairness is tweaked; 0.54
 * can be used as a stand-in because 0.5 leans too low.
 *
 * <p>
 * You can get values from this generator with: {@link #nextDouble()}, {@link #nextInt()},
 *   {@link #nextLong()}, and the bounded variants on each of those.
 * <p>
 * You can alter the tracking information or requested fairness with {@link #resetFortune()},
 *   {@link #setFairness(double)}, and {@link #getFairness()}.
