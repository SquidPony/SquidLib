/**
 * A wrapper class for working with random number generators in a more friendly way.
 * <p>
 * Includes methods for getting values between two numbers and for getting
 * random elements from a collection or array. There are methods to shuffle
 * a collection and to get a random ordering that can be applied as one shuffle
 * across multiple collections, such as via {@link OrderedMap#reorder(int...)},
 * {@link ArrayTools#reorder(ArrayList, int...)}, and so on. You can construct
 * an RNG with all sorts of RandomnessSource implementations, and choosing them
 * is usually not a big concern because the default works very well.
 * <br>
 * But if you do want advice on what RandomnessSource to use... LightRNG is the
 * default, and is very fast, but relative to many of the others it has a
 * significantly shorter period (the amount of random  numbers it will go through
 * before repeating the sequence), at {@code pow(2, 64)} as opposed to XorRNG and
 * XoRoRNG's {@code pow(2, 128)}. LightRNG also allows the current RNG state
 * to be retrieved and altered with {@code getState()} and {@code setState()}. For
 * most cases, you should decide between LightRNG, XoRoRNG, and other
 * RandomnessSource implementations based on your needs for period length and state
 * manipulation (LightRNG is also used internally by almost all {@link StatefulRNG}
 * objects). You might want significantly less predictable random results, which
 * {@link IsaacRNG} and {@link Isaac32RNG} can provide, along with a large period.
 * You may want a very long period of random numbers, which would suggest
 * {@link LongPeriodRNG} as the best choice. You may want better performance on
 * 32-bit machines or especially on GWT (which has to emulate Java's behavior with
 * 64-bit longs), which would mean {@link PintRNG} (for generating only ints via
 * {@link PintRNG#next(int)}, since its {@link PintRNG#nextLong()} method is very
 * slow) or {@link FlapRNG} (for generating ints and longs at relatively good speed
 * using mainly int math; also capable of the state changing that LightRNG can do).
 * {@link ThunderRNG} is the fastest generator we have, and has a decent period when
 * considering all bits, but if you only consider the less-significant bits then it
 * has a very poor period. This bad behavior is similar to how linear congruential
 * generators act, such as {@link java.util.Random}, which simply truncates off the
 * lower bits.

     * certain code that uses bits to represent data but needs a different ratio of set bits to unset bits than 1:1.
     * <br>
     * Implementors should limit any overriding method to calling and returning super(), potentially storing any extra
     * information they need to internally, but should not change the result. This works based on a delicate balance of
     * the RandomnessSource producing bits with an even 50% chance of being set, regardless of position, and RNG
     * subclasses that alter the odds won't work as expected here, particularly if those subclasses use doubles
     * internally (which almost always produce less than 64 random bits). You should definitely avoid using certain
     * RandomnessSources that aren't properly pseudo-random, such as any QRNG class (SobolQRNG and VanDerCorputQRNG,
     * pretty much), since these won't fill all 64 bits with equal likelihood.
