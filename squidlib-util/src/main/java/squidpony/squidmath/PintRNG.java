/**
 * A different kind of RandomnessSource that operates internally on ints, which may have significant advantages on GWT
 * since that toolchain has to emulate longs (slowly) for almost any math with them. It is, however, expected to be
 * slower on other platforms, at least platforms with 64-bit JVMs. Running on 32-bit desktop JVMs, 32-bit Dalvik on
 * Android, or other increasingly-rare environments may benefit from this class, though.
 * <br>
 * Quality is not completely certain, but should be excellent in this version since it's based almost directly on PCG-
 * Random's choices of numerical constants. The state changes differently with this than with PCG-Random, however, due
 * to performance issues on the JVM with the LCG-like state change, and instead it is added with a very large negative
 * number. Visual tests, at least, appear indistinguishable from other PRNGs. Period is considered very low, at 2^32,
 * but all seeds should be valid, including 0. Generating 64 bits of random data takes a little less than twice as much
 * time as generating 32 bits, since this can avoid some overhead via inlining.
 * <br>
 * The name can be construed as Pint-Size, since this has a small period and uses a smaller amount of space, or as
 * Permuted Int, since this is based on PermutedRNG, changed to use 32-bit operations on ints.
 * <br>
 * Based on work by Melissa E. O'Neill for PCG-Random, though no code is actually shared with PCG-Random.
