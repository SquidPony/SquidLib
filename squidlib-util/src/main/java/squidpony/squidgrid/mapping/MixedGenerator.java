/**
 * A dungeon generator that can use a mix of techniques to have part-cave, part-room dungeons. Not entirely intended for
 * normal use outside of this library, though it can be very useful when you want to make a dungeon match a specific
 * path and existing generators that use MixedGenerator aren't sufficient. You may want to use a simpler generator based
 * on this, like SerpentMapGenerator, which generates a long, winding path that loops around on itself. This supports
 * the getEnvironment() method, which can be used in conjunction with RoomFinder to find where separate room, corridor,
 * and cave areas have been placed.
 * <br>
 * Based on Michael Patraw's excellent Drunkard's Walk dungeon generator.
 * http://mpatraw.github.io/libdrunkard/
 * @see squidpony.squidgrid.mapping.SerpentMapGenerator a normal use for MixedGenerator that makes winding dungeons
 * @see squidpony.squidgrid.mapping.SerpentDeepMapGenerator uses MixedGenerator as it makes a multi-level dungeon
