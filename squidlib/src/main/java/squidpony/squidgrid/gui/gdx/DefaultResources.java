/**
 * Default BitmapFonts, a sample image, "stretchable" fonts and icons, and a central RNG for use with LibGDX.
 * All but one of the resources here need to be downloaded separately, to avoid bloating the size of the dependency jar
 * with many fonts that a game probably won't use. You can download assets in a jar with a release of SquidLib, or
 * individually from https://github.com/SquidPony/SquidLib/tree/master/assets . The assets you choose should go in the
 * android/assets (core/assets if you don't have an Android project) subfolder of your game if you use the normal libGDX
 * setup tool or SquidSetup, or the assets subfolder if you use czyzby's alternate setup tool,
 * https://github.com/czyzby/gdx-setup . They should not be placed in subdirectories of assets, otherwise this won't be
 * able to find them.
 * <br>
 * The fonts provided are mostly monospaced, with most looking rather similar (straight orthogonal lines and right-angle
 * curves), but some that look... better than the rest. For monospaced fonts that could be used on a grid in SquidPanel
 * or SquidLayers, one good choice is Inconsolata-LGC, accessible by getSmoothFont(), getLargeSmoothFont(), (ideally for
 * narrow glyphs) getStretchableFont(), or (ideally for square glyphs) getStretchableSquareFont(). Another is Computer
 * Modern, accessible by getStretchableTypewriterFont(), which has a chunky, ornamented style. For variable-width fonts
 * that can be used in TextPanel and LinesPanel, among others, you can use the high-quality serif font Gentium,
 * accessible by getStretchablePrintFont(), or Noto Sans, a clean sans font accessible by getStretchableCleanFont(). All
 * of the fonts so far support the Latin, Greek, and Cyrillic alphabets.
 * <br>
 * If you can't decide, go with getStretchableFont() or getStretchableSquareFont(), which return TextCellFactory
 * objects, and call their .width(int), .height(int), and .initBySize() methods to make them the size (and aspect ratio)
 * you want. You can use getStretchableFont() or getStretchableTypewriterFont() with the same width and height to make
 * a horizontally-stretched version of a square font instead of the existing square fonts that add blank space.
 * <br>
 * The most Latin script support for a monospaced font is in the font Mandrill, accessible by getDefaultUnicodeFont()
 * and getLargeUnicodeFont() in two different sizes, and the latter should be suitable for everything from Spanish and
 * French, to Polish to Vietnamese. You can use Gentium for even better language support with a variable-width font in
 * LinesPanel or the like; it is accessible with getStretchablePrintFont(). Google's Noto font also supports many glyphs
 * in a variable-width format; it is accessible with getStretchableCleanFont() but may have some issues with baseline
 * level changing and character-to-character alignment seeming too high or low.
 * <br>
 * The sample image is a tentacle taken from a public domain icon collection graciously released by Henrique Lazarini;
 * it's fitting for SquidLib to have a tentacle as a logo or something, I guess?
 * <br>
 * The icons are from http://game-icons.net , there are over 2000 of them, and they're among the only images that should
 * both be recolor-able easily (like chars in a font) and resize-able easily if you use a stretchable font at the same
 * time. The stretchable font TextCellFactories do some work with shaders that makes most images look incorrect, but
 * allow distance field fonts and these distance field icons to resize smoothly. Mixing stretchable fonts with
 * non-stretchable images or fonts is not a great idea, and usually involves a slow shader change back and forth.
 * <br>
 * You can get a default RNG with getGuiRandom(); this should probably not be reused for non-GUI-related randomness,
 * but is meant instead to be used wherever randomized purely-aesthetic effects are needed, such as a jiggling effect.

     * in use, and will seem hazy and indistinct if the shader hasn't been set up for a distance field effect by
     * TextCellFactory (which stretchable fonts will do automatically). The one page of the TextureAtlas is 2048x2048,
