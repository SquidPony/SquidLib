<span class="source-line-no">007</span><span id="line.7"> * A class that wraps an RNG and allows different String keys to be associated with biases toward low or high results</span>
<span class="source-line-no">008</span><span id="line.8"> * when a method is called that gets a number from the wrapped RNG. With this, you could make a category of "blessed" or</span>
<span class="source-line-no">009</span><span id="line.9"> * "cursed" biases that, instead of using a uniform distribution that produces all numbers approximately with equal</span>
<span class="source-line-no">010</span><span id="line.10"> * likelihood (with doubles between 0.0 and 1.0 averaging at 0.5), have different averages, like 0.7 for blessed or 0.3</span>
<span class="source-line-no">011</span><span id="line.11"> * for cursed, when generating between 0.0 and 1.0. You could also use this to favor or disfavor the player for "easy</span>
<span class="source-line-no">012</span><span id="line.12"> * mode" or "hard mode" categories of play.</span>
<span class="source-line-no">013</span><span id="line.13"> * &lt;br&gt;</span>
<span class="source-line-no">014</span><span id="line.14"> * The API allows you to associate an alternative average with a kind as a String, like "blessed to-hit" or "hard mode</span>

<span class="source-line-no">017</span><span id="line.17"> * HashMap lookup and lets you give flexibly-adjusted numbers, but does need more effort to change many values</span>
<span class="source-line-no">018</span><span id="line.18"> * throughout a codebase if averages aren't all generated by a formula. You can also set the distribution in the</span>
<span class="source-line-no">019</span><span id="line.19"> * constructor or by changing the public distribution field; you can use constants in this class, TRIANGULAR,</span>
<span class="source-line-no">020</span><span id="line.20"> * EXPONENTIAL, TRUNCATED, SOFT_TRIANGULAR, and EXP_TRI (the average of EXPONENTIAL and TRIANGULAR), for different</span>
<span class="source-line-no">021</span><span id="line.21"> * choices, with the default being EXP_TRI. Each one of these has different behavior regarding a preference toward</span>
<span class="source-line-no">022</span><span id="line.22"> * extreme values; TRIANGULAR almost never produces very high or very low values, EXPONENTIAL frequently produces the</span>
<span class="source-line-no">023</span><span id="line.23"> * highest or lowest values for high or low expected averages, respectively, TRUNCATED will simply never generate values</span>
<span class="source-line-no">024</span><span id="line.24"> * that are too far from the average (otherwise it's uniform), SOFT_TRIANGULAR will produce a rounded version of</span>
<span class="source-line-no">025</span><span id="line.25"> * TRIANGULAR's distribution with less of an angular peak and more frequent high and low values, and EXP_TRI will have</span>
<span class="source-line-no">026</span><span id="line.26"> * something like a curve shape that may "collide" slightly with the upper bound if the average is high enough.</span>
